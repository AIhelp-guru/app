      "options": ["a) 17.25", "b) 18", "c) 21", "d) 12"],
      "answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Let the numbers be x and 3x. Their sum is 23, so x + 3x = 23. Therefore, 4x = 23, so x = 5.75. The larger number is 3x = 17.25."

      "answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Let the integers be x and x+2. Then x^2 + (x+2)^2 = 340. This expands to 2x^2 + 4x - 336 = 0, which can be factored into (x-12)(x+14) = 0."
  },
  {
      "question": "A landscaper charges $30 for each lawn mowing job, plus a $15 service fee. If a customer has $300 to spend on lawn mowing, what is the maximum number of jobs the customer can afford?",

        "answer": "c",
        "explanation": "The vertical asymptote of a rational function occurs where the denominator is equal to zero. In this case, the denominator is zero when x = 2. The horizontal asymptote occurs when the degree of the numerator is less than or equal to the degree of the denominator. In this case, both the numerator and denominator have a degree of 2, so the horizontal asymptote is y = 1 (the ratio of the leading coefficients). Therefore, the equations of the asymptotes are x = 2 and y = 1."

        "answer": "b",
        "explanation": "The end behavior of a polynomial function is determined by the leading term. In this case, the leading term is -x^4, which is negative. As x approaches positive or negative infinity, the value of -x^4 becomes increasingly negative. Therefore, the end behavior is that m(x) approaches negative infinity."

        "explanation": "The equation of the tangent line to the graph of a function f(x) at x = a is y = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a). In this case, f(x) = e^x, f'(x) = e^x, and a = 1. Therefore, f(1) = e, f'(1) = e, and the equation of the tangent line is y = e + e(x - 1)."
