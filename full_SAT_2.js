    "explanation": "To solve the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - 15 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: $$x = \frac{-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)}{2a}$$. Plugging in the values a = 1, b = 2, and c = -15, we get: $$x = \frac{-2 ± √(2^2 - 4(1)(-15))}{2(1)} = \frac{-2 ± √(16 + 60)}{2} = \frac{-2 ± √76}{2} = \frac{-2 ± 2√19}{2} = -1 ± √19$$. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -1 + √19 and x = -1 - √19, which are approximately equal to 3 and -5, respectively.",

    "answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Notice that the blue parabola opens upward and has its vertex at (125, 80). It is also symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = 125. The equation of a parabola that opens upward and has its vertex at (h, k) is y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where a is a constant. Since the blue parabola has its vertex at (125, 80), its equation can be written as y = a(x - 125)^2 + 80. To find the value of a, we can use the fact that the parabola passes through the point (75, 80). Substituting these values into the equation, we get 80 = a(75 - 125)^2 + 80. Simplifying, we get 80 = a(-50)^2 + 80. Subtracting 80 from both sides, we get 0 = a(-50)^2. Dividing both sides by (-50)^2, we get a = 0.4. Therefore, the equation of the blue parabola is y = 0.4(x - 125)^2 + 80.",
